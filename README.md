# Mini AI Pipeline: Day vs Night Classification
This repository contains the code for the CAS2105 Mini AI Pipeline Project.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `CAS2105_...pdf`: The final project report.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with the implementation of the Baseline and AI Pipeline.
- `dataset/`: Small dataset of Day/Night images.

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage
This project was tested on **VESSL AI (Linux)**.

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

This project was tested on VESSL AI (Linux, Python 3.8+). To reproduce the results, please install the dependencies:

Run the notebook: Open notebooks/day_night_classifier.ipynb and run all cells.

# snips

- We labeled images based on semantic cues such as light source, rather than raw brightness.”
- Images were collected from public web sources (e.g., Google Images) for educational purposes only.
- All images were converted to JPEG format and RGB color space to ensure consistent preprocessing and avoid environment-specific issues.
- ### Environment
  All experiments were conducted in a clean Python virtual environment.
  The pipeline runs on CPU without requiring GPU or special server setup.
